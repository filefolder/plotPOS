# plotPOS version 0.1 
python plotter for POS (PBO Station Position Time Series) geodesy data, among other things

requires: Python3, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib. nothing too weird or new. could reverse engineer to python2.7 fairly somewhat easily.

the code as of now is geared towards GAMIT/GLOBK data (e.g. the format of the rename/eq files)
but with a little tweaking it should be easy enough to use anything. on that note the inspiration behind 
a lot of the aesthetic design here is based on the plots generated by sh_plot_pos (mike floyd) which 
is included in G/G (http://geoweb.mit.edu/gg/).

code needs a LOT of review and tweaking but if you just need some nice looking plots (and/or want to calculate coseismic
offsets and/or correct for these) you're good to go. 

./plotPOS.py -h for a list of commands

# features:

-calculates and optionally corrects for coseismic offsets, also writes these out as a gamit/globk "earthquake" .eq file 

---these are calulated via the position of several (weighted) low-pass filters

-plots these low-pass position filters (defaults to 3 months and 1 year)

-interactive mode to easily identify DOY dates for ill-fitting data (good for marking bad campaign data) 

# TODOs

-calculate both white and frequency-dependent noise via spectral fitting 

-make some plot settings more sane

-lots of tiny formatting issues

thanks & bear with me here. comments / tips / bug reports appreciated.
