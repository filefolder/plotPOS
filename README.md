# plotPOS version 0.1 
python plotter for POS (PBO Station Position Time Series) geodesy data, among other things

requires: Python3, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib. nothing too weird, probably any version. could reverse engineer to python2.7 fairly somewhat easily.

the code as of now is highly geared towards GAMIT/GLOBK data (e.g. the format of the rename/eq files)
but with a little tweaking it should be easy enough to use anything. on that note the inspiration behind 
a lot of the aesthetic design here is based on the plots generated by sh_plot_pos (mike floyd) which 
is included in G/G (http://geoweb.mit.edu/gg/).

code needs a LOT of review and tweaking but if you just need some nice looking plots (and/or want to calculate coseismic
offsets and/or correct for these) you're good to go. 

just set the parameters at the top and run via ./plotPOS.py <path/to/individual.pos> or <path/to/posdir> 

features:

-calculates and optionally corrects for coseismic offsets, also writes these out as a GG "earthquake file"

---these are calulated via the position of several (weighted) low-pass filters

-can plot residual (normalised) data trends (actually right now it ONLY plots residual trends ha)

-plots these low-pass position filters (defaults to 3 months and 1 year)

-interactive mode to easily identify DOY dates for ill-fitting data (good for campaign data)

-calculates freq^0 white noise (defined as scatter over a period < 3 months) 

big TODOs

-parallize the main loop for each datafile (i'm sure this is easy, but any recommendations for a method highly appreciated)

-calculate frequency-dependent noise via spectral fitting 

-incorporate flags for feature parameters

-make some plot settings more sane

thanks & bear with me here, i am (obviously) not a programmer and as of now not employed in any sort of geodetic capacity
so this is all for funsies, in an effort for fill in what appears to be a pretty significant gap for advanced geodetic
plotting.
