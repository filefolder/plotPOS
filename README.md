# plotPOS version 0.1 
python plotter for POS (PBO Station Position Time Series) geodesy data, among other things

requires: python3, numpy, scipy, matplotlib

the code as of now is geared towards GAMIT/GLOBK data (e.g. the format of the rename/eq files)
but with a little tweaking it should be easy enough to use anything. on that note the inspiration behind 
a lot of the aesthetic design here is based on the plots generated by sh_plot_pos (mike floyd) which 
is included in the wonderful gamit/globk suite (http://geoweb.mit.edu/gg/).

code needs review and tweaking but if you just need some nice looking plots (and/or want to calculate coseismic
offsets and/or correct for these) you're good to go. 

# example 
(for help)

$ plotPOS.py -h

(creates AUCK_fixed.png (offsets fixed) in dir "plots", also writes these offsets to an eq file, also shows a PSD figure)

$ plotPOS.py AUCK.anu.orbit_unkno.pos -plotdir plots -eqfiles auck.eq -fix_offsets -write_offsets -plot_spectral  -days_per_data 7

(creates AUCK.png in dir "plots", original data with offsets uncorrected)

$ plotPOS.py AUCK.anu.orbit_unkno.pos -plotdir plots -eqfiles auck.eq -days_per_data 7



# features

- fully parallel

- calculates and optionally corrects for coseismic offsets by comparing a series of weighted low pass filters
   (also optionally writes these out as a gamit/globk "earthquake" .eq file)

- plots these low-pass filters (defaults to 3 months & 1 year), even for non-uniform timeseries

- optionally plots power density spectra

- optional interactive mode to zoom in and easily identify DOY dates for ill-fitting data (good for marking bad campaign data) 

# TODOs

- calculate both white and frequency-dependent noise via spectral fitting 

- make some plot settings more sane

- output offset-corrected POS files (for use in noise calculations with tsfit etc)

- lots of tiny formatting issues

thanks & bear with me here. comments / tips / bug reports appreciated
